**Description:**  
This project explores different machine learning algorithms to predict ramen ratings using a dataset of over 2,500 reviews from the Ramen Rater. The goal is to forecast ramen star ratings based on features like brand, country, and style.

**Methods used:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, outliers, binning, normalization)
- Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Regression models: k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Lasso Regression, Ensemble (averaging), and Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics
- Model comparison and interpretation
